## Hi, I’m Cole 👋

I’m a first-year Computer Engineering student with an interest in building small, well-structured software projects and strengthening my problem-solving skills.  
I enjoy learning by experimenting, refining ideas, and understanding how systems behave under different constraints.

---

## Interests

- Software engineering and system design  
- Algorithmic problem-solving and competitive programming  
- Simulation-based and systems-driven applications  
- Interactive programs and desktop tools  

---

## What I’m working on

- Small Python and C++ projects with an emphasis on clarity and correctness  
- Desktop applications and UI experiments  
- Improving algorithmic thinking through competitive programming practice  

---

## What I’m learning

- Python for tooling, automation, and UI development  
- C++ with a focus on performance and low-level understanding  
- Data structures and algorithms  
- Git, GitHub, and basic project structuring  

---

## Competitive Programming

I practice competitive programming as a hobby and am currently working through the **USACO Guide**,  
using it to build strong fundamentals in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

---

## Background interests

I’m particularly interested in systems-heavy simulation games (such as Kenshi, Project Zomboid, and RimWorld),  
mainly for their emphasis on emergent behavior, resource management, and complex interactions rather than gameplay alone.

---

## Goals

- Develop strong programming fundamentals  
- Build a portfolio of small but thoughtfully designed projects  
- Continue improving through consistent practice during college
